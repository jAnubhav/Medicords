### Introduction:
**Medicords** (aka 'Medical Records') is more than just an ideaâ€”it's a revolution. Our vision is to securely store every individual's complete medical history on the blockchain, eliminating paper-based records and preventing any dilution, destruction, or tampering by individuals or organizations.

- Hospitals:
  - Register using their National Identification Number (NIN).
  - Use the portal to add and manage medical records for registered patients.

### Key Features:
1. Blockchain powered Security to critical data.
2. Anytime, anywhere access with permissions.
3. Cheaper Data Storage for Hospitals and Clinics.

### Tech Stack:
- Blockchain: Aptos (Rust-based)
- Smart Contracts: Move Programmming Language
- Blockchain Interactions: Aptos-SDK for Python
- Backend / API: Quart WebFramework for Python
- Frontend: ReactJS
